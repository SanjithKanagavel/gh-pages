	<p id="31af" class="graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">World needs stupid people.</em></strong> If you’re stupid, just pinch you’re really blessed. You’re going to survive and the world will support you for all the stupidious decisions you take.</p>
<p id="a0a5" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The Society needs stupid people, religions need stupid people, politicians need stupid people, every companies need stupid people to make their work out. Stupids are easy to manage, easy to dominate, easy to order, easy to manipulate, easy to adapt to any situations because they are satisfied with anything that pays them. Stupids adhere for everything they are asked to do and get satisfied with a limited sum of money to do deeds that would satisfy them and comparing among other stupids.</p>
<p id="fca3" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Stupid people basically don’t believe in them or don’t know why they are born in this paradise. They are visionless animals living for just to enjoy good meal daily. Any stupid person can be a perfect citizen, more stupid you’re more obedient you will be. Stupid don’t care about anything they do cruel things even if makes them happy. Bright example would be the stupid person who dropped the atom bomb on the Hiroshima that burn thousands of people life less than five seconds.</p>
<p id="012c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Stupid people are converted to machines. Give them any shit they will make it work. The society is cares about machine’s efficiency not you. Stupids will be good station masters, good collector, good politician but unintelligent. If he is intelligent he will not be a clerk or politician at all.</p>
<p id="f5da" class="graf--p graf-after--p">World is scared about intelligent people, because they believe in them. They learn from their failures. They chase their passion. They don’t believe things as the world says. They are cared about their career and work for betterment of future generations. They believe in making thing better.</p>
<p id="d0cf" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I wrote this post, since I was frustrated when my friends replied they are afraid chasing their dream when I questioned “ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do you chase your dream and become best in it ? ”</strong>. Don’t chase for money, chase for things that would really like you happy. You can live only once. Live it in best way. Chase your passions. If you don’t know what your passion is, just keep looking for it. When you know it for once, start chasing it. Start working on them. Take life your way. Build castle with pride not with dollars. Pride lasts forever but not the money.</p>
<p id="5d63" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Throw out all the past. Find the better you. Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t be afraid in taking decisions, every step is difficult at first when learning new things. Be a role model for people. You can either start your company or do a freelancing. You can post inspirational talks in youtube, you could start with blogging, you could become a life coach. You were meant to be different. Start sketching your success map. Believe in you. Spend sleepless nights for reaching your vision. All sacrifices that you would make will be paid through success. Just throw up with a small success snow ball from top of mountain. Nature would take up its work and the snow ball will get bigger and bigger when it rolls down the mountain.</p>
<p id="921c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">So, Ask yourself are you a stupid afraid in taking decisions ? Or an intelligent to live your life chasing passions ?</p>
<p id="85e6" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You’re the Michel Angelo or Picasso of your life :)</em></strong></p>
