Stupids are easy to manage, easy to dominate, easy to order, easy to manipulate, easy to adapt to any situations because they are satisfied with anything that pays them.

<p id="fca3" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Stupid people basically don’t believe in them or don’t know why they are born in this paradise. They are visionless animals living for just to enjoy good meal daily. Any stupid person can be a perfect citizen, more stupid you’re more obedient you will be. Stupid don’t care about anything they do cruel things even if makes them happy. Bright example would be the stupid person who dropped the atom bomb on the Hiroshima that burn thousands of people life less than five seconds.</p>

Positive thinking doesn't mean to keep your head in the sand and ignore life's less pleasant situations. Positive thinking means to approach difficult situations in a more <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>productive</strong> way. Believing and expecting <strong>positive results</strong> not the worst.
<blockquote><strong><em>Is your glass half-full or half-empty ?  </em></strong></blockquote>
Above age-old question differentiates positive from negative thinker. Positive thinker would answer it as <strong>half full</strong>. Be <strong>optimistic</strong>.
<blockquote><em>“The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” -  Winston Churchill</em></blockquote>
Everyone are <strong>naturally positive</strong> and even more <strong>excited</strong> when start learning new things or plan for a new diet. You set your own <strong>goals</strong> and look for ways to <strong>succeed</strong> them. Only you can <strong>reap</strong> your <strong>success</strong>.

<blockquote><em><strong>"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe it can acheive" </strong>- Napolean Hill</em></blockquote>
Our life is filled with experiences. When things are happening smoothly we are happy but in difficult situation we seem to throw tension and complain how unlucky we are. If we observe carefully it happened because we expected them to. This is called <strong>Law of Attraction</strong>. Positive thought attracts better things or if thoughts were negative it could make the day even worse.
<blockquote><em><strong>"You create your own universe as you go along" </strong>– Winston Churchill</em></blockquote>
Most of us don't achieve what we really want and always feel that we are limited to what things we can get in life. Aside from not feeling good about ourselves, we don't actually believe in ourselves. We don't believe that we can achieve whatever we want in life and that it is impossible. If a person looks at the bright side and believes that nothing is impossible he will achieve what he really wants.
<blockquote><em><strong>"To bring anything into your life, image that it already there" </strong>- Richard Bach</em></blockquote>
There are three simple steps that can help a person achieve, these steps are to <strong>ask</strong>, <strong>believe</strong>, and <strong>receive</strong>. A person should ask him what he really wants and then he should believe in it and feel that they will get it or actually they already have that thing he wants and then eventually with time that person will receive it. But the most important of these steps is to do them positively.
<blockquote><em><strong>"Believe that you can make it all happen for you"</strong></em></blockquote>

Yes,they help you to reach success. They always give you some hint about the your mistakes that led to failure.

No one is perfect in this world. We tend to make mistakes. It's a part of our life. Only Some people would try to find those mistakes and <em>correct them</em>. But most of them q<em>uit. </em>You are among that some not the most<em>.</em>

<strong>No one believes you until first success of your dream</strong>. Because they will not have that vision or they will not know that it's possible until you prove them. But it's the most difficult part of making your dream come true. But's it's possible through a secret formula.
